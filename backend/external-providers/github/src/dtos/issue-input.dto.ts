/* The `export interface IssueInput` is defining a TypeScript interface called
`IssueInput`. An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the shape or
structure of an object. In this case, the `IssueInput` interface has four
properties: `owner`, `repository`, `title`, and `body`, all of which are of
type `string`. This interface is exported, which means it can be imported and
used in other files. */
export interface IssueInput {
  owner: string;
